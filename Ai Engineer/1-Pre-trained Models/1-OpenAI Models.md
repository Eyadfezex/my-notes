# **Knowledge Cutoff Dates & Search Capabilities**

LLMs rely on training data up to a **cutoff date**, impacting their ability to provide current information.

| **Model**                 | **Knowledge Cutoff**     | **Real-time Search** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **GPT-4o / Mini / Turbo** | **Oct 2023**             | **Yes (Bing)**       |
| **GPT-3.5**               | **Dec 2023**             | **No**               |
| **Claude (Anthropic)**    | **Aug 2023**             | **No**               |
| **Google Gemini**         | **Continuously Updated** | **No**               |
| **Meta AI**               | **Dec 2023**             | **Yes**              |
| **Microsoft Copilot**     | **2021 + Updates**       | **Yes (Bing)**       |

⚡ **Implications**:

- **Outdated Responses**: Models cannot provide post-cutoff knowledge without search access.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Search-enabled models (e.g., GPT-4o, Copilot) can fetch real-time data.
