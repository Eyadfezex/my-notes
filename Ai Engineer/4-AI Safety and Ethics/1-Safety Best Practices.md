# AI Safety Best Practices

## 1. Content Moderation

AI moderation helps prevent the spread of harmful content such as hate speech, violence, and misinformation. It uses automated filtering, context-aware rules, and human oversight to ensure appropriate content moderation.

**Best Practices:**

- **Regularly update moderation models** to adapt to new threats and evolving harmful content.
- **Combine AI filtering with human review** to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
- **Enable user feedback** so users can report inappropriate content for further moderation.

## 2. Adversarial Testing

Adversarial testing involves intentionally challenging AI with deceptive or harmful inputs to identify vulnerabilities and improve security.

**Best Practices:**

- **Continuously test with manipulative prompts** to expose weaknesses in AI decision-making.
- **Use automated tools for security checks** to identify and mitigate risks in real time.
- **Train AI to detect and reject attacks** by learning from adversarial examples and improving response mechanisms.

## 3. Safe Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering refines how AI interprets and responds to inputs, ensuring security, accuracy, and reliability.

**Best Practices:**

- **Define AI roles for appropriate behavior** by structuring prompts to guide the modelâ€™s response.
- **Use structured outputs (e.g., JSON)** to enforce predictable and controlled AI-generated responses.
- **Monitor interactions for security risks** to detect and prevent potential misuse or exploitation.

## 4. User Safety & Privacy

Protecting user data is critical to maintaining trust and compliance with regulations.

**Best Practices:**

- **Use pseudonymous user IDs** instead of storing personal data to enhance privacy.
- **Minimize stored data** to reduce exposure in case of breaches.
- **Audit AI systems for compliance** with data protection laws like GDPR and industry standards.
