# AI Terminologies

## AI vs AGI

| **Aspect**         | **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**                                                                     | **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Task-specific intelligence for areas like speech recognition, image processing, and decision-making. | Theoretical AI with human-like cognitive abilities, capable of learning any task. |
| **Scope**          | Narrow, specialized applications.                                                                    | Broad, adaptable across various domains.                                          |
| **Capabilities**   | Performs only trained tasks, lacks generalization.                                                   | Hypothetically capable of autonomous learning and reasoning.                      |
| **Examples**       | Siri, Alexa, recommendation systems, chatbots.                                                       | Currently theoretical, seen in sci-fi representations.                            |
| **Current Status** | Widely used in industries like healthcare & finance.                                                 | No existing AGI, remains a research goal.                                         |

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

**Definition:** AI systems trained on vast datasets to understand and generate human-like text.

### Key Characteristics

- **Trained on Massive Data:** Text from books, articles, websites.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Use transformers to understand language context.
- **Versatile Applications:** Translation, summarization, chatbots, programming assistance.

### Training Process

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring datasets.
2. **Model Training:** Learning text patterns using neural networks.
3. **Fine-Tuning:** Optimizing for specific tasks.

### Considerations

- **Ethical Concerns:** Avoiding biases in training data.
- **High Resource Demand:** Requires powerful computational infrastructure.
- **Security Risks:** Susceptible to data manipulation and adversarial attacks.
