# Prompting Techniques

## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

AI performs a task without prior examples.

- **Example:** "Summarize this article in one paragraph."
- **Use Case:** Quick generalization tasks.

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Provides examples to guide AI responses.

- **Example:**
  - "Translate English to French:
    - English: Hello → French: Bonjour
    - English: How are you? → French: Comment ça va?"
- **Use Case:** Improves response accuracy.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Encourages step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.

- **Example:** "Explain step-by-step how you solved this math problem."
- **Use Case:** Logical reasoning tasks.

## 4. Role-Based Prompting

Assigns a persona for context-specific responses.

- **Example:** "As a financial advisor, suggest investment strategies."
- **Use Case:** Domain-specific guidance.

## 5. Least-to-Most Prompting

Breaks down complex problems into simpler sub-tasks.

- **Example:** "First, list key concepts; then, explain their relationships."
- **Use Case:** Multi-step problem-solving.

## 6. Dual-Prompt Approach

Uses an initial prompt to generate knowledge, then refines the response.

- **Example:** "Generate a brief history of AI. Now summarize it in 3 sentences."
- **Use Case:** Refinement and knowledge extraction.

## 7. Adversarial Prompting

Tests AI robustness by inputting misleading or complex queries.

- **Example:** "If AI is always right, what happens when two AIs disagree?"
- **Use Case:** AI security and bias detection.

## 8. Self-Consistency Prompting

Generates multiple responses and selects the most common or accurate one.

- **Example:** "Solve this riddle multiple times and choose the best answer."
- **Use Case:** Reduces errors in reasoning tasks.

## 9. Interactive Prompting

Engages AI in an iterative dialogue to refine responses.

- **Example:** "Rewrite this paragraph in a more formal tone. Now make it concise."
- **Use Case:** Enhances user-AI interaction.

## 10. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

AI retrieves relevant information from external sources before responding.

- **Example:** "Find the latest research on AI ethics and summarize it."
- **Use Case:** Improves factual accuracy.

## 11. Contrastive Prompting

Asks AI to compare multiple perspectives.

- **Example:** "Compare the benefits and drawbacks of remote work vs. in-office work."
- **Use Case:** Analytical and decision-making tasks.

## 12. Persona-Based Prompting

Instructs AI to mimic a specific style or viewpoint.

- **Example:** "Write a speech as if you were a 19th-century poet."
- **Use Case:** Creative and stylistic applications.
