# Prompting Techniques

## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

AI performs a task without prior examples.

- **Example:** "Summarize this article in one paragraph."
- **Use Case:** Quick generalization tasks.

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Provides examples to guide AI responses.

- **Example:**
  - "Translate English to French:
    - English: Hello → French: Bonjour
    - English: How are you? → French: Comment ça va?"
- **Use Case:** Improves response accuracy.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Encourages step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.

- **Example:** "Explain step-by-step how you solved this math problem."
- **Use Case:** Logical reasoning tasks.

## 4. Role-Based Prompting

Assigns a persona for context-specific responses.

- **Example:** "As a financial advisor, suggest investment strategies."
- **Use Case:** Domain-specific guidance.

## 5. Least-to-Most Prompting

Breaks down complex problems into simpler sub-tasks.

- **Example:** "First, list key concepts; then, explain their relationships."
- **Use Case:** Multi-step problem-solving.

## 6. Dual-Prompt Approach

Uses an initial prompt to generate knowledge, then refines the response.

- **Example:** "Generate a brief history of AI. Now summarize it in 3 sentences."
- **Use Case:** Refinement and knowledge extraction.

## 7. Adversarial Prompting

Tests AI robustness by inputting misleading or complex queries.

- **Example:** "If AI is always right, what happens when two AIs disagree?"
- **Use Case:** AI security and bias detection.

## 8. Self-Consistency Prompting

Generates multiple responses and selects the most common or accurate one.

- **Example:** "Solve this riddle multiple times and choose the best answer."
- **Use Case:** Reduces errors in reasoning tasks.

## 9. Interactive Prompting

Engages AI in an iterative dialogue to refine responses.

- **Example:** "Rewrite this paragraph in a more formal tone. Now make it concise."
- **Use Case:** Enhances user-AI interaction.

## 10. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

AI retrieves relevant information from external sources before responding.

- **Example:** "Find the latest research on AI ethics and summarize it."
- **Use Case:** Improves factual accuracy.

## 11. Contrastive Prompting

Asks AI to compare multiple perspectives.

- **Example:** "Compare the benefits and drawbacks of remote work vs. in-office work."
- **Use Case:** Analytical and decision-making tasks.

## 12. Persona-Based Prompting

Instructs AI to mimic a specific style or viewpoint.

- **Example:** "Write a speech as if you were a 19th-century poet."
- **Use Case:** Creative and stylistic applications.

## 13. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting

Allows AI to explore multiple reasoning paths before selecting the best solution.

- **Example:** "Consider different strategies to solve this logic puzzle and choose the best one."
- **Use Case:** Improves problem-solving in complex tasks.

## 14. Meta Prompting

Focuses on the structure and syntax of tasks rather than specific content details.

- **Example:** "Design a prompt format that extracts key information from news articles."
- **Use Case:** Prompt structure optimization.

## 15. Active Prompting

Enhances adaptability by selecting task-specific example prompts annotated with human-designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

- **Example:** "Choose the best reasoning pattern for solving algebraic equations."
- **Use Case:** Adaptive learning.

## 16. Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Enhances reasoning by integrating textual and visual inputs.

- **Example:** "Analyze this graph and explain the trend in text."
- **Use Case:** Visual question answering.

## 17. Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE)

Automatically generates and optimizes prompts to improve LLM performance.

- **Example:** "Find the most effective prompt structure for legal document summarization."
- **Use Case:** Automated prompt refinement.

## 18. Automatic Multi-step Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)

Generates multi-step prompts and integrates external tools to solve complex tasks.

- **Example:** "Use a calculator API to solve these finance-related queries."
- **Use Case:** External tool integration.

## 19. ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)

Combines reasoning with action to generate responses and execute tasks.

- **Example:** "Analyze this dataset and return key statistics."
- **Use Case:** AI-driven decision-making.

## 20. Self-Refinement Prompting

Encourages iterative review and improvement of AI responses.

- **Example:** "Check and improve your previous response for clarity and completeness."
- **Use Case:** Self-correcting AI outputs.

## 21. Problem Decomposition Prompting

Breaks down complex problems into smaller sub-problems for systematic solving.

- **Example:** "List the steps needed to automate a customer support chatbot."
- **Use Case:** Tackling large-scale problems.
