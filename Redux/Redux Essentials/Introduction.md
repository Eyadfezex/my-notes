# What is Redux?

Redux is a pattern and library for managing application state through actions. It provides a centralized store for shared state, ensuring predictable updates.

## Why Should I Use Redux?

Redux offers patterns and tools that clarify when, where, why, and how your application's state is updated, ensuring predictable behavior for your application logic.

## When Should I Use Redux?

Redux simplifies shared state management but introduces complexity and additional code. It adds indirection and constraints, balancing short-term productivity with long-term maintainability.

Redux shines in scenarios with:

- Extensive shared state needs across the application.
- Frequent state updates.
- Complex state update logic.
- Medium to large-sized codebases with multiple contributors.
