# Rules of Reducers

[reducer rules](../Terminology/Reducers.md)

Adhering to these rules is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Predictability**: Redux aims for code predictability. When a function's output relies solely on its input arguments, it's easier to understand and test. Unpredictable behavior due to external dependencies can lead to execution uncertainty.

2. **Maintainability**: Modifying values outside a function's scope can introduce bugs and unexpected behavior. Changes to arguments or external variables may cause inconsistencies, such as UI not updating as expected after state changes.
   <br>
3. **Debugging**: Following these rules aids debugging efforts by facilitating error identification. Predictable behavior helps pinpoint the source of issues, enabling efficient problem resolution.

4. **Redux DevTools Integration**: These rules ensure compatibility with Redux DevTools, enabling advanced debugging features. Consistent state updates and immutable changes allow DevTools to accurately track state modifications, aiding in debugging and state inspection.

Emphasizing immutable updates is critical for traceable and predictable state modifications, enhancing Redux application maintainability and reliability.
