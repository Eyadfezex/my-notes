# RTK Query and Streaming Updates: Limitations and Workarounds

While RTK Query (Redux Toolkit Query) doesn't natively handle full-fledged WebSocket-based streaming updates, you have several options to achieve real-time data updates within your application:

**1. Polling with `useQuery`**

- Use `useQuery` with the `pollingInterval` option for limited real-time updates. This periodically refetches data from the server, providing a sense of real-time behavior. However, it's not ideal for highly dynamic data as it introduces delays and network overhead.

**2. Refetching on Events**

- Manually trigger data updates using the `refetch` function provided by `useQuery` or `useMutation`. This is suitable for situations where events indicate the need for fresh data, such as a button click or receiving a server notification.

**3. Customizing RTK Query Behavior (Advanced)**

- If you have a strong understanding of RTK Query internals, you can leverage the `queryFn` or `infiniteQueryFn` options to integrate dedicated streaming libraries like Redux-WebSocket or Socket.IO. This provides more control over the streaming setup but requires significant development effort.

**Key Points:**

- Match the update method to the real-time requirements of your application. Polling is a simple approach for moderate updates, while event-based refetching and custom integration are suitable for more demanding scenarios.
- Be mindful of trade-offs like network overhead and complexity when choosing your approach.

**The `onCacheEntryAdded` Lifecycle for WebSocket Integration**

The [`onCacheEntryAdded`](../1-RTK%20Query%20API/createApi.md) lifecycle callback allows you to perform side effects after a new cache entry is created. This can be extremely useful for establishing WebSocket connections and handling incoming messages to update the cache with real-time data:

```javascript
// Import necessary functions from Redux Toolkit Query
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";

// Define a chat API slice named "chat"
const chatApi = createApi({
  // Define a unique identifier for this slice in the Redux store
  reducerPath: "chat",

  // Configure the base URL for all requests made within this chat API slice
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: "https://api.example.com/chat" }),

  // Define API endpoints using the builder function
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    // Define a query endpoint named "getMessages"
    getMessages: builder.query({
      // Define the query string for fetching messages
      query: () => "/messages",

      // Optional: Add additional configuration options specific to this query
      // (e.g., defining a custom transform response function)
      // ... other query options

      // Define a custom side effect to be executed after the query data is added to the cache
      onCacheEntryAdded: async (arg, { cacheDataLoaded, dispatch }) => {
        // Wait for the initial data to be loaded from the server
        await cacheDataLoaded;

        // Create a WebSocket connection to the chat server
        const socket = new WebSocket("wss://api.example.com/chat/ws");

        // Handle incoming messages from the WebSocket
        socket.onmessage = (event) => {
          const newMessage = JSON.parse(event.data);

          // Dispatch an action to update the cache with the new message data
          // This will trigger a re-render of components that rely on the chat data
          // (assuming you have appropriate selectors set up)
          dispatch(/* action to update cache with new message */);
        };
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

**Example Use Cases for Streaming Updates:**

- **GraphQL Subscriptions:** Establish a WebSocket connection to a GraphQL server to receive real-time updates based on subscriptions you've defined.
- **Real-time Chat Applications:** Maintain a persistent WebSocket connection to a chat server, receiving and sending messages in real-time.
- **Real-time Multiplayer Games:** Keep game state synchronized between players by utilizing WebSockets to exchange updates continuously.
- **Collaborative Document Editing:** Allow multiple users to edit a document concurrently in real-time using WebSockets for bidirectional communication.
