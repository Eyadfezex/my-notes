# ApiProvider

Can be used as a `Provider` if you **do not already have a Redux store**.

`ApiProvider` is a component from RTK Query that allows seamless integration of the API slice generated by [`createApi`](../0-RTK%20Query%20API/createApi.md) into React applications. It uses React's context mechanism to provide access to data fetching and caching functionality across the component tree via hooks like `useGetPostsQuery` and `useGetUsersQuery`.

## For Example

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { ApiProvider } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";
import { Pokemon } from "./features/Pokemon";

function App() {
  return (
    <ApiProvider api={api}>
      <Pokemon />
    </ApiProvider>
  );
}
```
