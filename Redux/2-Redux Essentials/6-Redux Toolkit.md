# Redux Toolkit

Imagine Redux is a toolbox for managing things in your application, but it has a lot of parts and requires some assembly. Redux Toolkit is like a pre-built toolkit that includes only the most useful tools from the original box, already put together and ready to use.

Redux Toolkit makes it easier to:

- Set up the state management system (like putting together the toolbox).
- Update the state (like using the tools).
- Write cleaner and less complicated code (like having the perfect tool for the job).
