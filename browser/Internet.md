Here's a breakdown of the provided notes on how the internet works and how we can search on websites:

**How Does the Internet Work?**

1. **Data Storage**: Data is stored in servers located in different places around the world.
2. **Data Transfer**: Data is transferred around the world through a complicated network of optical fiber cables.
3. **Accessing Data**: Users can access data from fiber cables by connecting to Wi-Fi or using cellular data.
4. **IP Address**: An IP address is a unique identity code for every device connected to the internet.

**How Can We Search on Websites?**

1. **IP Address and Domain Name**: Websites are stored on servers with IP addresses, but domain names are used to access them for user convenience.
2. **DNS Server**: The Domain Name System (DNS) server translates domain names into IP addresses when users enter them in their browsers.
3. **Data Center**: Requests are sent to the data center where the website is hosted, after obtaining the IP address.
4. **Data Transmission**: Data is transmitted through fiber cables from the data center to the user's device.
5. **Access Methods**: Data can be received through Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, or cellular data, with cellular connections established via cell towers.
6. **ICANN**: The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages domain names and IP address assignments.
7. **Data Transmission Format**: Data between devices is transmitted in binary code (0s and 1s).
8. **HTTP Protocol**: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) facilitates the request and response cycle for transferring data between web servers and clients.

These notes provide an overview of how the internet functions and how users can search and access websites.
