# Internet

## How Does the Internet Work?

1. **Data Storage**:

   - Data is stored on servers distributed globally, which act as storage centers for the internet's information.

2. **Data Transfer**:

   - Data travels across the world through a complex network of optical fiber cables, enabling rapid and large-scale data movement.

3. **Accessing Data**:

   - Users access this data by connecting their devices to the internet via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular data networks.

4. **IP Address**:
   - Every device connected to the internet is assigned a unique identity code known as an IP address, which helps in identifying and locating the device in the network.

## How Can We Search on Websites?

1. **IP Address and Domain Name**:

   - While websites reside on servers with specific IP addresses, domain names provide an easy-to-remember way to access these sites.

2. **DNS Server**:

   - The Domain Name System (DNS) server translates human-friendly domain names into corresponding IP addresses when users type them into their browsers.

3. **Data Center**:

   - Once the IP address is obtained, the request is routed to the data center where the website is hosted.

4. **Data Transmission**:

   - The requested data is then transmitted from the data center to the userâ€™s device through fiber cables.

5. **Access Methods**:

   - Users receive the data via various means, including Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, or cellular data, with mobile connections facilitated by cell towers.

6. **ICANN**:

   - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for managing the assignment of domain names and IP addresses globally.

7. **Data Transmission Format**:

   - Data between devices is transferred in binary form (0s and 1s), which computers can process and interpret.

8. **HTTP Protocol**:
   - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) governs the request-response cycle, enabling data transfer between web servers and clients.
