The web browser works through several key components and steps:

1. **Browser Life Cycle**:

   - The browser life cycle runs through 7 base components:
     1. User interface.
     2. Browser engine.
     3. Rendering engine.
     4. Networking.
     5. JavaScript interpreter.
     6. UI backend.
     7. Data like cookies.

2. **Browser Working Steps**:
   - **Resource Gathering**:
     - The web browser uses networking modules to gather all the different resources on the Internet.
   - **Parse HTML & Create DOM Tree**:
     - The browser parses HTML code and creates a DOM tree, which is a hierarchical representation of all HTML elements in the page.
   - **Error Checking**:
     - The browser checks the HTML code for any errors.
   - **Create Render Tree from DOM Tree**:
     - The browser constructs a render tree from the DOM tree. In this step, CSS styles are applied to the HTML elements.
   - **Layout**:
     - Once the render tree is constructed, the browser performs layout or "reflow" to determine the position and size of each render object on the screen.
   - **Painting**:
     - The final step is to paint the content onto the screen. This involves rendering pixels based on the layout information and the visual styles of each rendered object.

These steps illustrate the process by which a web browser fetches and renders web pages, ultimately displaying them to the user.
