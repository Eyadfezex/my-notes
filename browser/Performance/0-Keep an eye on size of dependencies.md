# Keep an Eye on Dependency Sizes

It's crucial to monitor the size of your dependencies to maintain optimal bundle performance. Large dependencies can lead to increased load times and negatively impact user experience.

## Tools to Analyze and Optimize Bundle Size

- **[ai/size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit):** Helps measure your bundle size and provides insights into its impact on performance.
- **[Next Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next.js):** Visualizes the size of your webpack output files, allowing you to identify and optimize large modules.

### Tips for Better Performance

1. **Remove Unused Dependencies:** Regularly audit and remove unused or redundant packages.
2. **Use Tree Shaking:** Ensure your build system is configured to eliminate unused exports from your modules.
3. **Lazy Loading:** Split your code into smaller chunks and load them only when needed.
4. **Prefer Lightweight Libraries:** Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives when possible.
5. **Monitor Changes:** Continuously track the impact of new dependencies on your bundle size.

By keeping your bundle size small, you can improve loading times, enhance performance, and create a better user experience.
