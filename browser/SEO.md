Here's a breakdown of the provided notes on SEO basics and how Google works:

**SEO Basics:**

- **What is SEO?**
  - SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a set of practices and strategies aimed at improving a website's visibility on search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. The primary goal is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic by optimizing various elements, both on and off the website, to make it more attractive to search engines.

- **Why is SEO Important?**
  - Unlike paying for ads, search traffic is free.
  - Organic traffic is typically consistent once you're ranking high.
  - SEO offers the opportunity to reach massive audiences.

**How Google Works:**

- **Crawling & Indexation:**
  - **Crawling:**
    - Definition: Crawling refers to the process by which search engine bots (spiders or crawlers) systematically browse the internet, going from one page to another by following links.
    - Purpose: Crawling aims to discover and gather information from web pages. The crawler analyzes content, follows links to other pages, and repeats the process.
  - **Indexation:**
    - Definition: Indexation involves storing and organizing the information collected during crawling in a search engine's index. The index serves as a catalog of web pages deemed worthy of inclusion in search results.
    - Purpose: Indexed pages are considered when users enter search queries, providing relevant and timely results.

- **Google's Ranking Algorithm:**
  - A complex system Google uses to decide how pages will rank in search results, believed to consider hundreds of factors.
  - Google's ranking factors include backlinks (links from one website to another), search intent (the reason behind a user's search query), and content depth.
