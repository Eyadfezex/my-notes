## componentDidUpdate Lifecycle Method in React

In React, `componentDidUpdate` is a lifecycle method available in class components that is invoked immediately after updating occurs. It's called after a component's state or props have been updated, but before the component re-renders.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of `componentDidUpdate` is to perform actions that need to take place after the component's state or props have been updated and the component has re-rendered. This includes tasks such as:

- Performing side effects based on changes in props or state.
- Updating the DOM in response to state changes.
- Fetching additional data when props change.

## Parameters

- `prevProps`: The previous props before the update.
- `prevState`: The previous state before the update.
- `snapshot`: An optional value returned by the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` method.

### Syntax

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Perform side effects, update DOM, etc.
  }

  render() {
    // Render JSX
  }
}
```
