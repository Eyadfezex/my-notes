## static propTypes in React

In React, `static propTypes` is a class property that allows you to specify the expected types for props in a class component. It's used for type-checking props to ensure that they conform to the expected data types, improving code reliability and maintainability.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of `static propTypes` is to define the expected types for props in a component. By specifying propTypes, you can catch potential bugs caused by incorrect prop types early in development and provide clear documentation for component usage.

### Syntax

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    propName: PropTypes.type,
    // Additional propTypes
  };

  render() {
    // Render JSX using props
  }
}
```
