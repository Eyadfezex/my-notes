## componentDidMount Lifecycle Method in React

In React, `componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method available in class components that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the DOM tree). It is commonly used for performing initialization tasks, data fetching, or subscribing to external events within the component.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of `componentDidMount` is to perform actions that need to take place after the component has been rendered to the DOM for the first time. This includes tasks such as:

- Fetching data from an API.
- Setting up subscriptions or event listeners.
- Performing DOM manipulations.

### Syntax

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Perform initialization tasks, data fetching, etc.
  }

  render() {
    // Render JSX
  }
}
```
