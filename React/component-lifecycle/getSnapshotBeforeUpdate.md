## getSnapshotBeforeUpdate Lifecycle Method in React

In React, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` is a lifecycle method available in class components that is invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM. It allows the component to capture some information from the DOM before it is potentially changed by the update.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` is to capture information from the DOM (such as scroll position or the dimensions of an element) before it's potentially changed due to an update. This allows the component to preserve this information and restore it after the update is complete.

## Parameters

- `prevProps`: The previous props before the update.
- `prevState`: The previous state before the update.

### Syntax

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Capture information from the DOM
    // Return a snapshot value or null
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
    // Access the snapshot value returned by getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
  }

  render() {
    // Render JSX
  }
}
```
