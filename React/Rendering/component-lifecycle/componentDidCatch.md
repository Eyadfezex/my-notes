# componentDidCatch Lifecycle Method in React

In React, `componentDidCatch` is a lifecycle method available in class components that is invoked when an error occurs within the component tree of a class component. It provides a way to catch and handle errors that occur during rendering, in lifecycle methods, or in the constructor of any child component.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `componentDidCatch` is error handling and error boundary creation. An error boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire component tree.

## Parameters

- `error`: The error that was thrown.
- `info`: An object containing information about the error, including its component stack trace.

## Syntax

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  state = {
    hasError: false,
  };

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Update state to indicate that an error has occurred
    this.setState({ hasError: true });
    // Log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error("Error caught by ErrorBoundary:", error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Display a fallback UI when an error occurs
      return <div>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</div>;
    }
    // Render the children normally if no error has occurred
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```
