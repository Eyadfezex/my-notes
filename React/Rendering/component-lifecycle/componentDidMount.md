# componentDidMount Lifecycle Method in React

In React, `componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method available in class components that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the DOM tree). It is commonly used for performing initialization tasks, data fetching, or subscribing to external events within the component.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `componentDidMount` is to perform actions that need to take place after the component has been rendered to the DOM for the first time. This includes tasks such as:

- Fetching data from an API.
- Setting up subscriptions or event listeners.
- Performing DOM manipulations.

## Syntax

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data from an API after the component is mounted
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => {
        // Update the component's state with the fetched data
        this.setState({ data });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.data ? (
          <div>Data: {this.state.data}</div>
        ) : (
          <div>Loading...</div>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```
