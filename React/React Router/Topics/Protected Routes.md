# Protected Routes

Protected routes in web applications ensure that certain parts of the application are accessible only to authenticated users. These routes are designed to enhance security and control access to sensitive information or functionalities.

## Implementation in React Router

To implement protected routes effectively using React Router, a custom `PrivateRoute` component can be created. This component is responsible for verifying the user's authentication status before rendering the content of a specific route.
