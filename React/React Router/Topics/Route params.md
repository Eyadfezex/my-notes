# Route params

1- route parameters are used to define dynamic parts of the URL within your application.

2- These parameters are specified in the route definition using a colon followed by the parameter name.

3- React Router then parses these parameters from the URL and makes them available to your components.

## purpose

- Route parameters are useful for creating dynamic routes in React applications, especially when dealing with scenarios like displaying user profiles, accessing specific resources, or filtering content based on dynamic criteria.
