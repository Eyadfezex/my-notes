# What is the React Router?

React Router is ``` a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications.

## MPA VS SPA

    1- MPA

        - MPAs(Multi-page Apps): the client sends a request to the server for each page. The server handles scripts, CSS, and API calls. The browser replaces the old page with the new one upon receiving the server's response.

    2- SPA

        - SPAs (Single-page Apps): the server initially sends a React app, not HTML, to the client. When the user navigates to different pages, JavaScript handles the routing client-side. It intercepts URL changes, fetches data via AJAX requests, and updates the DOM accordingly. No full page reloads occur, providing a smoother user experience.
