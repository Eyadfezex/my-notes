# React Component

A React component is a reusable piece of UI that can be defined as either a class or a function. It encapsulates logic and returns JSX to describe how it should appear on the screen.

## React Class Component

A React class component is a JavaScript class that extends the `React.Component` class from the React library. It allows you to define components in a more object-oriented way, with features like lifecycle methods and state management. Class components have a `render()` method that returns the JSX (JavaScript XML) to be rendered to the DOM.

## React Functional Component

A React functional component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX, describing what should be rendered to the DOM. It's typically used for simpler components without lifecycle methods or state management.
