## JSX in React

JSX is a syntax extension in React that lets you write HTML-like code within JavaScript for defining UI components.

### Purpose

JSX simplifies the process of creating and composing UI components in React by allowing you to write familiar HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript code. It provides a more intuitive and declarative way to describe the structure and appearance of your UI.

### Example

```jsx
import React from "react";

function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is a JSX example.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
