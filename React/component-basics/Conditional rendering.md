Conditional rendering in React

    > allows you to display different components or UI elements based on conditions or state values. This flexibility enables you to dynamically control what appears on the screen, depending on user interactions or application logic. This can be achieved using JavaScript conditional statements, ternary operators, logical AND (`&&`) operators, or conditional rendering outside JSX.
