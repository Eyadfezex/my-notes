## Custom Hooks

React provides built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, and `useEffect`. If you require more specific functionality, such as data fetching or monitoring online status, you can create custom Hooks tailored to your application's requirements.

## Over view

- Hook name always start with `use`.

- **Reusable Logic**: Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate logic (such as state management, side effects, or any other functionality) and reuse it across different components without duplicating code.

- **Stateful**: They can also contain state variables using the `useState` hook or any other hooks that manage state.
