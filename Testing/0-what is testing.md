# What is Software Testing?

Software testing is a crucial process in software development that involves evaluating an application to uncover any **defects**, **errors**, or **issues** within its **functionality**, **performance**, **security**, and **usability**. By thoroughly examining the software, testing ensures that it not only meets the specified requirements but also functions as intended. Additionally, it identifies any potential bugs that could impact user experience or cause the system to fail.

Testing plays a vital role in delivering high-quality software that is reliable, secure, and user-friendly.

## Key Objectives of Software Testing

The main goals of software testing include:

- **Verification and Validation**: Confirming that the software aligns with both technical specifications and business requirements, ensuring it delivers the intended results and fulfills its purpose.

- **Reliability**: Testing the softwareâ€™s stability under different conditions, including both typical and unusual scenarios, to ensure consistent and dependable performance.

- **Security**: Detecting and addressing any vulnerabilities to protect the application from potential threats, safeguarding data and system integrity.

- **Usability**: Ensuring that the software is intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly, enabling users to easily navigate and interact with it.

Software testing is an iterative process carried out through various stages, including **unit testing** (testing individual components), **integration testing** (checking interactions between components), **system testing** (evaluating the whole application), and **acceptance testing** (validating with end users or clients). This multi-layered approach helps to catch issues early, enhance the user experience, and ensure the final product is robust, secure, and ready for release.
