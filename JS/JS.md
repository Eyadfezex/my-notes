Here's a breakdown of the provided notes on the DOM tree and JavaScript closures:

**DOM Tree:**

- The DOM tree is the structure of nodes/elements created by the browser from HTML tags.
- According to the Document Object Model (DOM), every HTML tag is an object, and nested tags are "children" of the enclosing one. Text inside a tag is also considered an object.
- All HTML objects are accessible using JavaScript, allowing modification of the page.
- Tags are element nodes forming the tree structure, with `<html>` at the root, followed by `<head>` and `<body>` as its children.

**JS Closures:**

- A closure gives access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
- Closures are illustrated through an example where an inner function (`innerFunction`) accesses a variable (`outerVariable`) defined in an outer function (`outerFunction`).
- When `outerFunction` is invoked, and `innerFunction` is returned and stored in a variable (`closure`), a closure is created.
- Even after `outerFunction` finishes executing, the closure retains access to `outerVariable` when `closure()` is called.
- Closures are useful for creating private variables, maintaining state between function calls, and implementing various design patterns in JavaScript.

These notes provide an understanding of the DOM tree's structure and the concept of closures in JavaScript, along with their applications and usefulness.
