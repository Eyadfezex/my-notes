# Callbacks

A callback in programming is a function that's passed as an argument to another function. This allows the first function (often called the higher-order function) to call the second function (the callback) at some point in its execution, potentially after some asynchronous operation completes.

- **The Callback Function:** You define a function that performs a specific task. This function will be the callback.

- **Passing the Callback:** You pass the callback function as an argument to another function (the caller function).

- **The Caller Function:** The caller function takes the callback function as an argument. It might perform some initial work or start an asynchronous operation.

- **Triggering the Callback:** When the caller function finishes its initial work or the asynchronous operation completes, it invokes the callback function that was passed to it.

- **Processing the Result (Optional):** The callback function can optionally process any data or results that were generated by the caller function or the asynchronous operation.

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation that takes 2 seconds
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("Welcome aboard!");
    callback();
  }, 2000);
}

function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hi there!");
}

greet("Alice", sayHi); // Pass sayHi function as callback

// Output:
// Hello, Alice!
// Hi there!  (This will be printed after 2 seconds)
// Welcome aboard! (This will also be printed after 2 seconds)
```

## Callback hell

Callback hell refers to a situation in asynchronous programming where you end up with deeply nested callback functions. This can happen when you chain multiple asynchronous operations together, with each operation requiring a callback function to be executed once it's finished.
