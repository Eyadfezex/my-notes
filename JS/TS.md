Here's a breakdown of the provided notes on TypeScript's simple data types:

**TypeScript Overview:**

- TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript (JS), which means it extends JavaScript by adding additional features, with one of the significant features being static typing.
- Static typing allows developers to define types for variables, parameters, and return values, enabling better code quality through type checking.

**Simple Data Types in TypeScript:**

- When creating a variable in TypeScript, there are two main ways to assign a type:
  - **Explicit Typing**:
    - In explicit typing, you write out the type explicitly when declaring the variable.
    - Example: `let firstName: string = "Dylan";`
  - **Implicit Typing**:
    - In implicit typing, TypeScript infers the type based on the assigned value.
    - Example: `let firstName = "Dylan";`

In both cases, TypeScript provides flexibility by allowing developers to choose whether to explicitly specify types or let TypeScript infer them based on the assigned values.
