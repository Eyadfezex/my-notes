# Type Casting

Type casting means conversion of one data type to another explicitly. In JavaScript some of the most common methods to convert a datatype to either string using `String()`, to boolean using `Boolean()`, or to number using `Number()`.

**Type conversion**

Type conversion (or typecasting) means transfer of data from one data type to another.

**Type coercion**

Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers)
**Examples**

```js
const value1 = "5";
const value2 = 9;
let sum = value1 + value2;

console.log(sum);
```

## Implicit and Explicit type casting

**Implicit**
In implicit type casting, the programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed.

**Explicit**
Explicit type casting, also known as type conversion or type coercion, occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another.
