# What is a data structure?

Data structures are organized ways to store and manage collections of data in computers. They provide efficient access and manipulation of data, like choosing the right filing cabinet for easy document retrieval. Different types (arrays, linked lists, etc.) exist for various purposes, and the best choice depends on your data and operations. Their efficiency is measured by time (speed) and space (memory usage).
