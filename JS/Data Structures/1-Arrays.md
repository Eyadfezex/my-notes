# Arrays

In JavaScript, arrays store collections of items and let you access them by **position**. JavaScript arrays are cool! Unlike some languages, they can mix data types and grow/shrink on the fly, making them handy for various data.

```js
const arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
console.log(arr[2]); // c

//--------------------------------------------------------

const arr = ["store", 1, "whatever", 2, "you want", 3];
```
