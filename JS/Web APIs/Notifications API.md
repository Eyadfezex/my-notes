# Notifications API Overview

The **Notifications API** enables web applications to display notifications to users outside the context of the web page. It is a powerful tool for improving user engagement, especially for applications that require timely updates or alerts.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Permission Model**

- **User Consent**: Notifications require explicit user permission.
- Use the `Notification.requestPermission()` method to request access.
- Permission states:
  - `granted`: Notifications are allowed.
  - `denied`: Notifications are blocked.
  - `default`: User has not made a decision.

### 2. **Notification Object**

- Represents a single notification instance.
- Can display system-level notifications.

## Usage Example

### Requesting Permission

```javascript
Notification.requestPermission().then((permission) => {
  if (permission === "granted") {
    console.log("Notification permission granted.");
  }
});
```

### Creating a Notification

```javascript
if (Notification.permission === "granted") {
  const notification = new Notification("Hello, World!", {
    body: "This is a test notification.",
    icon: "/icon.png", // Path to an icon image
  });

  // Add event listeners
  notification.onclick = () => {
    console.log("Notification clicked!");
  };
}
```

## Notification Options

- **Title**: A string for the notification title.
- **Body**: Text displayed below the title.
- **Icon**: A URL to an image for the icon.
- **Actions**: Buttons users can interact with.
- **Vibration Pattern**: Pattern of vibration for supported devices.

```javascript
const options = {
  body: "Don't forget to check your tasks!",
  icon: "/task-icon.png",
  actions: [
    { action: "open", title: "Open App" },
    { action: "dismiss", title: "Dismiss" },
  ],
  vibrate: [200, 100, 200],
};
const notification = new Notification("Task Reminder", options);
```

---

## Events

- **`onclick`**: Fired when the notification is clicked.
- **`onclose`**: Fired when the notification is closed.
- **`onshow`**: Fired when the notification is displayed.
- **`onerror`**: Fired when there is an error displaying the notification.

```javascript
notification.onclick = () => {
  console.log("Notification was clicked!");
};
```

---

## Limitations and Considerations

1. Notifications may vary depending on the operating system and browser.
2. Notifications are displayed outside the browser context, requiring careful design to avoid spamming users.
3. Best practice: Provide clear value and use notifications sparingly.

## Browser Compatibility

- Widely supported in modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- Safari has limited support and might require additional settings.
