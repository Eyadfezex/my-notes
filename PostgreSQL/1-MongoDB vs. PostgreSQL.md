# MongoDB vs PostgreSQL: Key Differences

## Overview

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL, document-oriented database designed for flexibility and scalability.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, and SQL compliance.

| **Type**                  | NoSQL, document-oriented database                                           | Relational database management system (RDBMS)                                    |
| **Data Model**            | Document-based (BSON/JSON-like), schema-less, flexible                      | Table-based, structured, requires predefined schema                              |
| **Query Language**        | MongoDB Query Language (MQL)                                                | SQL (Structured Query Language)                                                  |
| **Scalability**           | Horizontal scaling (sharding)                                               | Vertical scaling (with extensions like Citus for horizontal scaling)             |
| **Performance**           | Optimized for high write throughput and read-heavy workloads                | Optimized for complex queries and transactional consistency                      |
| **Use Cases**             | Real-time analytics, content management, mobile apps, IoT, time-series data | Financial apps, geospatial data, complex transactional systems, data warehousing |
| **Extensibility**         | Limited extensibility, supports plugins and integrations                    | Highly extensible with custom data types, functions, and extensions              |
| **ACID Compliance**       | Multi-document ACID transactions (since version 4.0)                        | Fully ACID-compliant                                                             |
| **Community & Ecosystem** | Strong community, growing ecosystem, popular in cloud-native applications   | Mature community, extensive ecosystem, decades of development                    |
| **Managed Services**      | MongoDB Atlas                                                               | Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL                              |
