# What’s an ACID-Compliant Database?

## Overview

ACID compliance is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. It ensures data integrity and consistency, even in the event of errors, power failures, or other issues.

### What is ACID?

ACID stands for:

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit. It either completes entirely or not at all.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent, even in the event of a system failure.

## Why ACID Compliance Matters

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents data corruption and ensures accuracy.
- **Reliability**: Guarantees that transactions are processed reliably.
- **Concurrency Control**: Manages multiple transactions occurring simultaneously without conflicts.

## ACID-Compliant Databases

ACID compliance is commonly associated with **SQL databases** like:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Oracle
- SQL Server

However, some **NoSQL databases** (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) also offer ACID compliance for specific use cases.

## Trade-offs of ACID Compliance

While ACID compliance ensures reliability, it can come with trade-offs:

- **Performance**: ACID-compliant databases may have slower write speeds due to the overhead of ensuring consistency and durability.
- **Scalability**: Strict ACID compliance can make horizontal scaling more challenging.

## Building on Top of SQL and NoSQL Data

Modern applications often use a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases to balance performance, scalability, and reliability. Tools like **Retool** enable developers to build applications on top of these databases without worrying about the underlying complexities.

### Key Considerations

1. **Use SQL Databases** for transactional data requiring ACID compliance.
2. **Use NoSQL Databases** for unstructured data or high scalability needs.
3. **Leverage Tools** like Retool to integrate and manage data from multiple sources seamlessly.

## Conclusion

ACID compliance is critical for applications that require data integrity and reliability. While SQL databases are traditionally ACID-compliant, NoSQL databases are increasingly adopting these principles. By understanding the strengths and trade-offs of each database type, developers can build robust applications that meet their specific needs.
