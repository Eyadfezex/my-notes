# What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that builds upon concepts introduced by the original POSTGRES project at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Features

- **SQL Standard Support**: Implements a significant portion of the SQL standard.
- **Advanced Queries**: Supports complex queries with powerful SQL capabilities.
- **Foreign Keys & Constraints**: Ensures data integrity through foreign keys and constraints.
- **Triggers & Updatable Views**: Enhances data manipulation and automation.
- **Transactional Integrity**: Provides ACID-compliant transactions.
- **Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Enables high performance with concurrent transactions.

## Extensibility

Users can extend PostgreSQL by adding:

- New data types
- Custom functions
- Operators
- Aggregate functions
- Index methods
- Procedural languages

## Licensing

PostgreSQL is licensed under a permissive open-source license, allowing free use, modification, and distribution for private, commercial, or academic purposes.

## Official Documentation

## Advantages and Disadvantages of RDBMS

## Advantages of RDBMS

- **Data Integrity**: Enforces data accuracy and consistency through constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.
- **Data Security**: Offers robust security measures, allowing administrators to set access permissions.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large amounts of data and scaling to accommodate growth.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures reliable transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability properties.
- **Data Independence**: Separates data structure from applications, allowing schema changes without affecting data access.

## Disadvantages of RDBMS

- **Complexity**: Designing and managing relational databases can be complex, especially for large systems.
- **Performance Overhead**: Complex queries and large datasets can lead to performance issues.
- **Scalability Limitations**: Scaling horizontally can be challenging, often requiring significant resources.
- **Cost**: Implementation and maintenance can be expensive, particularly with commercial RDBMS solutions.
- **Rigid Schema**: The fixed schema makes it difficult to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.
